Somewhere along the way, building websites became a nightmare.

You need a framework to build a blog. A router for a 3-page site. A GraphQL layer just to read a Markdown file. Dev servers. Plugins. Config files for config files.

It’s all backwards.

**Rift is here to fix that.**

### 🪓 Cut the Stack. Keep the Output.

Rift doesn’t pretend to be a framework. It’s not here to run your app, ship a SPA, or abstract your way into hell.

It just builds HTML — from real data, real templates, and real code you control.

No runtime. No hydration. No magic bundles. Just pages.

### ⚙️ What Do You Actually Need?

To build a fast, modern, SEO-friendly site, you need:

* Static HTML
* Clean URLs
* Dynamic content mapping
* Templating
* Pagination and localization
* Styling and responsiveness

That’s it.

You don’t need:

* JSX pipelines
* 12 layers of plugins
* Bracket-based routing
* Framework-specific "head" components

Rift gives you the first list, and none of the second.

### 🧠 Built for Developers, Not Framework Fans

If you want to install a theme and never look under the hood — Rift isn’t for you.

But if you want to:

* Write your own controller logic
* Own your URLs
* Keep your templates clean
* Avoid surprise behavior

Then Rift gives you the toolbox — and gets out of your way.

### ⚡ Bring Your Own Everything

You want to use Tailwind? Go for it.

Nunjucks templates? Already supported.

Markdown? Yep.

You’re not locked into a framework. You’re not told how to write CSS. You can build what you want — because you’re in charge.

---

### 🧪 It Starts with a Command

```bash
npm create rift@latest
```

That’s the last bit of magic you’ll need. Everything after that? Yours.
