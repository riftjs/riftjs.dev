### The Problem with Modern SSGs

Developers often grapple with the complexities of current static site generators:

1. **Excessive Complexity**: Frameworks like Next.js and Astro introduce intricate configurations and dependencies.

2. **Limited Flexibility**: Tools such as Hugo enforce rigid structures, hindering customization.

3. **Performance Overhead**: Many SSGs generate unnecessary client-side JavaScript, impacting load times.

4. **Opaque Routing**: Routing mechanisms in some frameworks can be convoluted, leading to unexpected behaviors.

### RiftJS in Action

Here's how you can define a page in RiftJS:([teleporthq.io][2])

```javascript
export const params = ({ content }) => ({
  title: content.title,
  date: content.date,
});

export const permalink = ({ content }) => `/posts/${content.slug}/`;

export const render = ({ content }) => `
  <article>
    <h1>${content.title}</h1>
    <p>${content.body}</p>
  </article>
`;
```



This approach offers clear and direct control over your site's structure and content.
